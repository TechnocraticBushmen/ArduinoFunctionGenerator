ArduinoFunctionGenerator
========================
Working on initial version. Not functional yet.

FEATURES:
- supported wave functions: Sine, Square, Triangle, Ramp (sawtooth), Pulse
- supported settings: frequency, amplitude, offset

TODO:
 - PWM output in play mode
 - output biasing amplitude circuitry
 - fix noisy buttons thing. perhaps a capacitor or something.
 - custom setting for each type of wave function
 - CAD file for electronics schematic (some help would be greatly appreciated)
 - CAD file for box, perhaps even some 3d printer stuff.

Hardware used for development:
 - http://www.robofun.ro/arduino/arduino-kit - basically an arduino uno
 - http://www.robofun.ro/lcd/lcd_16x2_negru_verde

Will add more meta as the software progresses.
