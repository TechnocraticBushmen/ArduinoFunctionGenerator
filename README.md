ArduinoFunctionGenerator
========================
Working on initial version.
TODO:
 - button input & settings (don't know whether to save settings on internal storage)
 - general display functions
 - play/pause interrupt bug.
 - PWM output in play mode
 - output biasing amplitude circuitry
 - CAD file for electronics schematic (some help would be greatly appreciated)
 - CAD file for box, perhaps even some 3d printer stuff.

Hardware used for development:
 - http://www.robofun.ro/arduino/arduino-kit - basically an arduino uno
 - http://www.robofun.ro/lcd/lcd_16x2_negru_verde

Will add more meta as the software progresses.
